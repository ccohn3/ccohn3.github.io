    "section": "",
    "text": "Throughout the Major League Baseball season, fans could tell that there were a few teams that stood above the rest. The Dodgers, Braves, Orioles and Rays had fantastic seasons and looked to be World Series favorites. But all of these favorites were upset by either the Texas Rangers or the Arizona Diamondbacks enroute to the World Series.\nWere the Diamondbacks even a good team during the regular season? What starpower did they have besides a speedy rookie named Corbin Carroll?\nWas Arizona the most mediocre team to make the playoffs this year? What do the numbers say?\nTo start, here are the teams with the best records from the regular season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nbat &lt;- read_csv(\"mlbbatting.csv\")\npitch &lt;- read_csv(\"mlbpitching.csv\")\nmlbscores &lt;- read_csv(\"mlbgamescores23.csv\")\n\ntotalstats &lt;- bat |&gt;\n  inner_join(pitch, by=c(\"Tm\" = \"Tm\")) \n\ndifferential &lt;- totalstats |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    RunDifferential = R.x - R.y\n  ) |&gt;\nfilter(Tm != \"NA\")|&gt;\n  filter(Tm != \"League Average\")\n\nnlplayoff &lt;- c(\"Milwaukee Brewers\", \"Atlanta Braves\",\"Los Angeles Dodgers\",\"Philadelphia Phillies\",\"Miami Marlins\")\n\nteamlabels &lt;- c(\"Milwaukee Brewers\",\"Atlanta Braves\",\"Los Angeles Dodgers\",\"Philadelphia Phillies\",\"Miami Marlins\",\"Arizona Diamondbacks\",\"Oakland Athletics\",\"Texas Rangers\")\n\nnl &lt;- differential |&gt;\n  filter(Tm %in% nlplayoff)\n\nnewlabels &lt;- differential |&gt;\n  filter(Tm %in% teamlabels)\n\noak &lt;- differential |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"Oakland Athletics\")\n\ntex &lt;- differential |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"Texas Rangers\")\n\nhr &lt;- bat |&gt;\n  filter(HR &lt; 308)\n\nnewpitch &lt;- pitch |&gt;\n  filter(Tm != \"League Average\")\n\nnlfilter &lt;- newpitch |&gt; filter(Tm %in% nlplayoff) |&gt; mutate(Playoff = \"NL Playoff Team\") |&gt; select(Tm, Playoff)\n\nnlpitch &lt;- newpitch |&gt; left_join(nlfilter)\n\ndbpitch &lt;- newpitch |&gt; filter(Tm == \"Arizona Diamondbacks\")\n\nnyy &lt;- differential |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"New York Yankees\")\n\ndbacks &lt;- differential |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"Arizona Diamondbacks\")\n\nrecords &lt;- mlbscores |&gt;\n  group_by(Tm) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalWins = max(Wins),\n    TotalLosses = max(Losses)\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(TotalWins))\n\n ariwins &lt;- records |&gt;\n  filter (Tm == \"ARI\") \n\ntexwins &lt;- records |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"TEX\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=records, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, TotalWins), x=TotalWins, xend=TotalLosses),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"orange\") +\n    geom_dumbbell(\n    data=ariwins, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, TotalWins), x=TotalWins, xend=TotalLosses),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"maroon\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"orange\") +\n    geom_dumbbell(\n    data=texwins, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, TotalWins), x=TotalWins, xend=TotalLosses),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"red\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"orange\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Wins\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Diamondbacks carry the weight of worst NL playoff record\", \n    subtitle=\"Arizona had 84 &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;Wins&lt;/span&gt;, and 78 &lt;span style = 'color:orange;'&gt;losses&lt;/span&gt; last season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Camden Cohn\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Diamondbacks finished six games over .500 on the season, tied for the worst mark out of the teams that made the playoffs. Did Arizona just experience a losing streak in the middle of the season or were they really just a middle of the pack team?\nA couple of statistics that really show how dominant a team was throughout the season are runs scored per game, runs allowed per game and run differential. Were the Diamondbacks actually a force in the National League this season?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=differential, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, size=RunDifferential), color = \"grey\"\n    ) +\n    geom_point(\n    data=dbacks, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, size=RunDifferential), color = \"maroon\"\n    ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=nl, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, size=RunDifferential), color = \"blue\"\n    ) +\n geom_vline(xintercept = 4.615312)+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 4.61625) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=newlabels, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=oak, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, size=RunDifferential), color = \"darkgreen\"\n    ) +\n   geom_text_repel(\n    data=oak, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=tex, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, size=RunDifferential), color = \"red\"\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Runs Scored Per Game\", \n    y=\"Runs Allowed Per Game\", \n    title=\"From mediocrity to the World Series\", \n    subtitle=\"The Diamondbacks allowed more runs per game and scored less than MLB average.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Camden Cohn\",\n    size = \"Run Differential\"\n    ) +\ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Diamondbacks allowed more runs per game than the MLB average and scored fewer runs per game than the MLB average too. They are the most mediocre team in Major League Baseball according to this chart. They also had a negative run differential on the season at -15. Arizona allowed the most runs per game of any of the National League playoff teams and scored fewer runs per game than both the Dodgers and the Phillies, teams that they ended up beating in the playoffs.\nAnother couple of stats that often show team success are home runs and strikeouts. Where do the Diamondbacks rank in the league compared to other teams?\n\n\nCode\n bar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data = hr, aes(x=reorder(Tm, HR), weight=HR)) +\n  geom_bar(data = dbacks, aes(x=reorder(Tm, HR.x), weight=HR.x), fill=\"maroon\") +\n  geom_bar(data = nl, aes(x=reorder(Tm, HR.x), weight=HR.x), fill=\"blue\") +\n  geom_bar(data=tex, aes(x=reorder(Tm, HR.x), weight=HR.x),fill=\"red\") +\ncoord_flip() +\nlabs(title=\"\", \n     subtitle=\"\", x=\"\", y=\"Home Runs\") +\ntheme_minimal()\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data = nlpitch, aes(x=reorder(Tm, SO), weight=SO, fill=Playoff)) +\n  geom_bar(data = dbpitch, aes(x=reorder(Tm, SO), weight=SO), fill=\"maroon\") +\n  geom_bar(data = tex, aes(x=reorder(Tm,SO.y), weight=SO.y),fill=\"red\")+\ncoord_flip() +\nlabs(title=\"\", \n     subtitle=\"\", x=\"\", y=\"Strikeouts\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"blue\", \"lightgrey\")) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n  )\nbar1 + bar2 +\n plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Diamondbacks prove power isn't everything\",\n    subtitle = \"They were in the bottom third of the league in both home runs and batters struck out.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Camden Cohn\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank (),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nArizona was in the bottom third of the league in total home runs, just behind the Marlins and ahead of the Brewers, but they were also in the bottom of the league in strikeouts thrown. Behind all of the other National League playoff teams and coincidentally right behind the other World Series team, the Texas Rangers.\nThe Diamondbacks return a lot of players from this past year’s team and will look to improve on their first World Series appearance since 2001. As you can see, there’s plenty of room for improvement next season."

I am a junior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln majoring in Sports Media & Communication as well as Broadcasting with a minor in Communication Studies.\nI am passionate about sports and the broadcasting industry and am constantly seeking opportunities to grow my skills and knowledge in these fields.\n\nI have been able to broadcast Nebraska football, baseball, softball and basketball games as well as high school state basketball and volleyball on UNL’s student radio station, KRNU. Through these experiences, I have gained valuable hands-on experience and live reps as well as developing my communication skills and a strong work ethic.\n\nIn addition to my work with KRNU, I recently started an internship as a Production Intern with the Huskers Radio Network. I help to produce broadcasts on the network as well as the nightly show called “Sports Nightly.”\n\nI have also had the pleasure to work with Fox Sports as a student worker for football broadcasts. In this role, I assisted with a variety of tasks but mainly as a parabolic mic operator. This experience gave me a deeper understanding of the behind-the-scenes work that goes into producing a successful broadcast on the biggest of stages.\n\nLooking ahead, I am eager to continue to build my skills and experience in the sports media and broadcasting industries.

    "text": "The 2023 Nebraska football season started with high hopes, like every other season. The Huskers had won the offseason by hiring a new head coach, bringing in a new transfer quarterback from Georgia Tech named Jeff Sims, and by retaining key talent on the defense.\nThe defense held up their end of the bargain but the offense was atrocious. In the first game of the season at Minnesota, Sims threw three interceptions setting the tone for what would become one of the worst offenses in the Power Five conferences in points per game.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\nscoringoffenseurl &lt;- \"http://www.cfbstats.com/2023/leader/national/team/offense/split01/category09/sort01.html\"\nscoringoffense &lt;- scoringoffenseurl |&gt;\n  read_html() |&gt;\n  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id=\"content\"]/div[2]/table') |&gt;\n  html_table()\nscoringoffenses &lt;- scoringoffense[[1]] |&gt; rename(Rank = 1)\n\npassingoffenseurl &lt;- \"http://www.cfbstats.com/2023/leader/national/team/offense/split01/category02/sort01.html\"\npass &lt;- passingoffenseurl |&gt;\n  read_html() |&gt;\n  html_nodes(xpath= '//*[@id=\"content\"]/div[2]/table') |&gt;\nhtml_table()\npassingoffense &lt;- pass [[1]] |&gt; rename(Rank = 1)\n\nbigten &lt;- c(\"Penn State\",\"Michigan\",\"Michigan State\",\"Ohio State\",\"Maryland\",\"Rutgers\",\"Indiana\",\"Iowa\",\"Wisconsin\",\"Minnesota\",\"Northwestern\",\"Illinois\",\"Purdue\",\"Nebraska\")\n\nbigpass &lt;- passingoffense |&gt;\n  filter(Name %in% bigten)\n\nturnoversurl &lt;- \"http://www.cfbstats.com/2023/leader/national/team/offense/split01/category12/sort01.html\"\nturn &lt;- turnoversurl |&gt;\n  read_html() |&gt;\n  html_nodes(xpath= '//*[@id=\"content\"]/div[2]/table') |&gt;\nhtml_table()\nturnovers &lt;- turn[[1]] |&gt; rename(Rank = 1)\n\nnupassingurl &lt;- \"http://www.cfbstats.com/2023/team/463/passing/offense/gamelog.html\"\n\nbigtenwest &lt;- c(\"Iowa\",\"Wisconsin\",\"Minnesota\",\"Northwestern\",\"Illinois\",\"Purdue\",\"Nebraska\")\n\npowerfive &lt;- c(\"Boston College\",\"Clemson\",\"Duke\",\"Florida State\",\"Georgia Tech\",\"Louisville\",\"Miami (Florida)\", \"North Carolina\",\"NC State\",\"Pittsburgh\",\"Syracuse\",\"Virginia\",\"Virginia Tech\",\"Wake Forest\",\"Baylor\",\"BYU\",\"Cincinnati\",\"Houston\",\"Iowa State\",\"Kansas\",\"Kansas State\",\"Oklahoma\",\"Oklahoma State\",\"TCU\",\"Texas\",\"Texas Tech\",\"UCF\",\"West Virginia\",\"Arizona\",\"Arizona State\",\"California\",\"UCLA\",\"Colorado\",\"Oregon\",\"Oregon State\",\"USC\",\"Stanford\",\"Utah\",\"Washington\",\"Alabama\",\"Arkansas\",\"Auburn\",\"Florida\",\"Georgia\",\"Kentucky\",\"LSU\",\"Ole Miss\",\"Mississippi State\",\"Missouri\",\"South Carolina\",\"Tennessee\",\"Texas A&M\", \"Vanderbilt\",\"Penn State\",\"Michigan\",\"Michigan State\",\"Ohio State\",\"Maryland\",\"Rutgers\",\"Indiana\",\"Iowa\",\"Wisconsin\",\"Minnesota\",\"Northwestern\",\"Illinois\",\"Purdue\",\"Nebraska\")\n\npowerfivescoringoffense &lt;- scoringoffenses |&gt;\n  filter(Name %in% powerfive)\n\nbigwestscoring &lt;- scoringoffenses |&gt;\n  filter(Name %in% bigtenwest)\n\nnuscoring &lt;- bigwestscoring |&gt;\n  filter(Name == \"Nebraska\")\n\nnuturn &lt;- turnovers |&gt;\n  filter(Name == \"Nebraska\")\n\ntempleturn &lt;- turnovers |&gt;\n  filter(Name == \"Temple\")\n\nbigtenturn &lt;- turnovers |&gt;\n  filter(Name %in% bigten)\n\nnupassingurl &lt;- \"http://www.cfbstats.com/2023/team/463/passing/index.html\"\n\n numistakepassing &lt;- nupassingurl |&gt;\n  read_html() |&gt;\n  html_nodes(xpath= '//*[@id=\"content\"]/div[2]/table') |&gt;\nhtml_table()\nnumistake &lt;- numistakepassing [[1]] |&gt; rename(Rank=1)\n\nnupassingplayers &lt;- numistake |&gt;\n  filter(Name != \"Total\" & Name != \"Opponents\")\n\nbigqb &lt;- \"http://www.cfbstats.com/2023/leader/827/player/split01/category02/sort09.html\"\n\nb1gqb &lt;- bigqb |&gt;\n  read_html() |&gt;\n  html_nodes(xpath= '//*[@id=\"content\"]/div[2]/table') |&gt;\nhtml_table()\n\nbadbigqbstats &lt;- b1gqb [[1]] |&gt; rename(Rank=1)\n\nbigqbstat &lt;- badbigqbstats |&gt;\n  filter(Name != \"Heinrich Haarberg\") |&gt;\nfilter(Att &gt; 50)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = powerfivescoringoffense, aes(x=reorder(Name, `Points/G`),weight=`Points/G`),fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bigwestscoring, aes(x=reorder(Name, `Points/G`),weight=`Points/G`),fill=\"blue\") +\n  geom_bar(data = nuscoring, aes(x=reorder(Name, `Points/G`),weight=`Points/G`),fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Points Per Game\", \n    title=\"Huskers Scoreboard Strike\", \n    subtitle=\"Nebraska was in the bottom third of the Big Ten in points per game and struggled to score in conference play.\", \n    caption=\"Source: CFB Stats | By Camden Cohn\",\n    ) +\ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska played in the Big Ten West division which isn’t exactly known for its explosive offenses but yet they were tied for last with Iowa at 18.0 points per game. Eighteen points won’t win you many games in the competitive Big Ten Conference.\nBut it wasn’t just the lack of scoring by the offense, they also turned the ball over more than any other team in the entire country, a whopping 31 times.\n\n\nCode\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(\n    data=turnovers, \n    aes(x=`Total Gain`, y=`Total Lost`, size=`Margin`), color = \"grey\"\n    ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=bigtenturn, \n    aes(x=`Total Gain`, y=`Total Lost`, size=`Margin`), color = \"blue\"\n  )+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=bigtenturn, \n    aes(x=`Total Gain`, y=`Total Lost`, label=Name)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=nuturn, \n    aes(x=`Total Gain`, y=`Total Lost`, size=`Margin`), color = \"red\"\n    ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=templeturn, \n    aes(x=`Total Gain`, y=`Total Lost`, size=`Margin`), color = \"maroon\"\n  )+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=templeturn, \n    aes(x=`Total Gain`, y=`Total Lost`, label=Name)) +\n   geom_vline(xintercept = 16.86466)+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 16.45865) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Turnovers Forced\", \n    y=\"Turnovers Lost\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's Ball Security Blues\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers had the second worst turnover margin and put the ball on the ground more than\\n any other team.\", \n    caption=\"Source: CFB Stats | By Camden Cohn\",\n    size = \"Turnover Margin\"\n    ) +\ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nIt certainly didn’t help that the defense was below average at forcing turnovers but that’s a discussion for another day. The Huskers had the second worst turnover margin in the country at -17, Temple, another school that head coach Matt Rhule has coached at was the only team worse at -20, coincidence? The fact that Nebraska was able to get to five wins is gobsmacking.\nIf you turn the ball over at the magnitude that the Huskers do, you need to have a dynamic offense and that usually starts with the quarterback. The Nebraska quarterbacks were anything but that as they frequently gifted opposing defenses the football.\n\n\nCode\nbigqbstat &lt;- bigqbstat |&gt; \n  bind_rows(nupassingplayers) |&gt;\n  mutate(highlight = case_when(Team == \"Nebraska\" ~ \"Yes\", Team != \"Nebraska\" ~ \"No\"))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=bigqbstat, \n    aes(y=reorder(Name,Yards), x=Int, xend=TD),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\") +\n   geom_dumbbell(\n    data=nupassingplayers, \n    aes(y=reorder(Name,Yards), x=Int, xend=TD),\n    size = 3,\n    colour = \"red\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\") +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Touchdowns\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's quarterbacks provide more gifts than Santa\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers had more &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;interceptions&lt;/span&gt; than &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;passing touchdowns&lt;/span&gt; this past season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: CFB Stats | By Camden Cohn\",\n    ) +\ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the three Nebraska quarterbacks that started a game, only one of them had as many interceptions as passing touchdowns, Heinrich Haarberg had seven touchdowns and seven interceptions. Chubba Purdy had three picks and two touchdowns and Jeff Sims had six interceptions compared to one touchdown…that doesn’t include his fumbles either.\nThe quarterbacks at the top of the Big Ten, Kyle McCord at Ohio State and J.J. McCarthy at Michigan had 24 touchdowns to six interceptions and 19 touchdowns to four interceptions respectively. That’s a massive difference in quarterback performance compared to Nebraska’s quarterbacks and one of the reasons that those teams are top 10 in the entire country and the Huskers are nowhere close.\nMaybe next season with a new quarterback and another year under offensive coordinator Marcus Satterfield, the offense will be able to score more than 18 points but until then, there’s another offseason to win."
