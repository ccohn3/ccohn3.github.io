    "text": "Hi. My name is Camden Cohn. I am a junior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln majoring in Sports Media & Communication as well as Broadcasting with a minor in Communication Studies.\nI am passionate about sports and the broadcasting industry and am constantly seeking opportunities to grow my skills and knowledge in these fields.\n\nI have been able to broadcast Nebraska football, baseball, softball and basketball games as well as high school state basketball and volleyball on UNL’s student radio station, KRNU. Through these experiences, I have gained valuable hands-on experience and live reps as well as developing my communication skills and a strong work ethic.\n\nIn addition to my work with KRNU, I recently started an internship as a Production Intern with the Huskers Radio Network. I help to produce broadcasts on the network as well as the nightly show called “Sports Nightly.”\n\nI have also had the pleasure to work with Fox Sports as a student worker for football broadcasts. In this role, I assisted with a variety of tasks but mainly as a parabolic mic operator. This experience gave me a deeper understanding of the behind-the-scenes work that goes into producing a successful broadcast on the biggest of stages.\n\nLooking ahead, I am eager to continue to build my skills and experience in the sports media and broadcasting industries. I am dedicated to pursuing my passion and making meaningful contributions to the field."
