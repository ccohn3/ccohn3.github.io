    "text": "Throughout the Major League Baseball season, fans could tell that there were a few teams that stood above the rest. The Dodgers, Braves, Orioles and Rays had fantastic seasons and looked to be World Series favorites. But all of these favorites were upset by either the Texas Rangers or the Arizona Diamondbacks enroute to the World Series.\nWere the Diamondbacks even a good team during the regular season? What starpower did they have besides a speedy rookie named Corbin Carroll?\nWere the D-Backs the most mediocre team to make the playoffs this year? Let’s see what the numbers say.\nTo start, here are the teams with the best records from the regular season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nbat &lt;- read_csv(\"mlbbatting.csv\")\npitch &lt;- read_csv(\"mlbpitching.csv\")\nmlbscores &lt;- read_csv(\"mlbgamescores23.csv\")\n\ntotalstats &lt;- bat |&gt;\n  inner_join(pitch, by=c(\"Tm\" = \"Tm\")) \n\ndifferential &lt;- totalstats |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    RunDifferential = R.x - R.y\n  ) |&gt;\nfilter(Tm != \"NA\")|&gt;\n  filter(Tm != \"League Average\")\n\nnlplayoff &lt;- c(\"Milwaukee Brewers\", \"Atlanta Braves\",\"Los Angeles Dodgers\",\"Philadelphia Phillies\",\"Miami Marlins\")\n\nteamlabels &lt;- c(\"Milwaukee Brewers\",\"Atlanta Braves\",\"Los Angeles Dodgers\",\"Philadelphia Phillies\",\"Miami Marlins\",\"Arizona Diamondbacks\",\"Oakland Athletics\",\"Texas Rangers\")\n\nnl &lt;- differential |&gt;\n  filter(Tm %in% nlplayoff)\n\nnewlabels &lt;- differential |&gt;\n  filter(Tm %in% teamlabels)\n\noak &lt;- differential |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"Oakland Athletics\")\n\ntex &lt;- differential |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"Texas Rangers\")\n\nhr &lt;- bat |&gt;\n  filter(HR &lt; 308)\n\nnewpitch &lt;- pitch |&gt;\n  filter(Tm != \"League Average\")\n\nnlfilter &lt;- newpitch |&gt; filter(Tm %in% nlplayoff) |&gt; mutate(Playoff = \"NL Playoff Team\") |&gt; select(Tm, Playoff)\n\nnlpitch &lt;- newpitch |&gt; left_join(nlfilter)\n\ndbpitch &lt;- newpitch |&gt; filter(Tm == \"Arizona Diamondbacks\")\n\nnyy &lt;- differential |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"New York Yankees\")\n\ndbacks &lt;- differential |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"Arizona Diamondbacks\")\n\nrecords &lt;- mlbscores |&gt;\n  group_by(Tm) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalWins = max(Wins),\n    TotalLosses = max(Losses)\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(TotalWins))\n\n ariwins &lt;- records |&gt;\n  filter (Tm == \"ARI\") \n\ntexwins &lt;- records |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"TEX\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=records, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, TotalWins), x=TotalWins, xend=TotalLosses),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"orange\") +\n    geom_dumbbell(\n    data=ariwins, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, TotalWins), x=TotalWins, xend=TotalLosses),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"maroon\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"orange\") +\n    geom_dumbbell(\n    data=texwins, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, TotalWins), x=TotalWins, xend=TotalLosses),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"red\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"orange\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Dbacks: worst record out of the teams that made the MLB playoffs\", \n    subtitle=\"Arizona had 84 &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;Wins&lt;/span&gt;, and 78 &lt;span style = 'color:orange;'&gt;losses&lt;/span&gt; last season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Camden Cohn\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Diamondbacks finished six games over .500 on the season, tied for the worst mark out of the teams that made the playoffs this past season. Did Arizona just experience a losing streak in the middle of the season or were they really just a middle of the pack team?\nA couple of statistics that really show how dominant a team was throughout the season are runs scored per game, runs allowed per game and the run differential. Were the Diamondbacks actually a force in the National League this season?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=differential, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, size=RunDifferential), color = \"grey\"\n    ) +\n    geom_point(\n    data=dbacks, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, size=RunDifferential), color = \"maroon\"\n    ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=nl, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, size=RunDifferential), color = \"blue\"\n    ) +\n geom_vline(xintercept = 4.615312)+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 4.61625) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=newlabels, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=oak, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, size=RunDifferential), color = \"darkgreen\"\n    ) +\n   geom_text_repel(\n    data=oak, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=tex, \n    aes(x=`R/G`, y=`RA/G`, size=RunDifferential), color = \"red\"\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Runs Scored Per Game\", \n    y=\"Runs Allowed Per Game\", \n    title=\"From Mediocrity to the World Series\", \n    subtitle=\"The Diamondbacks allowed more runs per game than average and scored less runs per game \\n than the average MLB team.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Camden Cohn\",\n    size = \"Run Differential\"\n    ) +\ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe D-Backs allowed more runs per game than the MLB average and they scored fewer runs per game than the MLB average. They are the most mediocre team in Major League Baseball according to this bubble chart. They also had a negative run differential on the season at -15. Arizona allowed the most runs per game of any of the National League playoff teams and scored fewer runs per game than both the Dodgers and the Phillies, teams that they ended up beating in the playoffs.\nAnother couple of stats that often show team success are home runs and strikeouts. Where do the Diamondbacks rank in the league compared to other teams?\n\n\nCode\n bar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data = hr, aes(x=reorder(Tm, HR), weight=HR)) +\n  geom_bar(data = dbacks, aes(x=reorder(Tm, HR.x), weight=HR.x), fill=\"maroon\") +\n  geom_bar(data = nl, aes(x=reorder(Tm, HR.x), weight=HR.x), fill=\"blue\") +\n  geom_bar(data=tex, aes(x=reorder(Tm, HR.x), weight=HR.x),fill=\"red\") +\ncoord_flip() +\nlabs(title=\"\", \n     subtitle=\"\", x=\"\", y=\"Home Runs\") +\ntheme_minimal()\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data = nlpitch, aes(x=reorder(Tm, SO), weight=SO, fill=Playoff)) +\n  geom_bar(data = dbpitch, aes(x=reorder(Tm, SO), weight=SO), fill=\"maroon\") +\n  geom_bar(data = tex, aes(x=reorder(Tm,SO.y), weight=SO.y),fill=\"red\")+\ncoord_flip() +\nlabs(title=\"\", \n     subtitle=\"\", x=\"\", y=\"Strikeouts\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"blue\", \"lightgrey\")) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n  )\nbar1 + bar2 +\n plot_annotation(\n    title = \"The Diamondbacks were not the most overpowering team in the league\",\n    subtitle = \"They were in the bottom third of the league in both home runs and batters struck out.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Camden Cohn\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank (),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nArizona was in the bottom third of the league in total home runs, just behind the Marlins and ahead of the Brewers but they were also in the bottom of the league in strikeouts thrown. Behind all of the other National League playoff teams and coincidentally right behind the other World Series team, the Rangers.\nThe Diamondbacks return a lot of players from this past year’s team and will look to improve on their first World Series appearance since 2001. As you can see, there’s plenty of room for improvement next season."

    "text": "Hi. My name is Camden Cohn. I am a junior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln majoring in Sports Media & Communication as well as Broadcasting with a minor in Communication Studies.\nI am passionate about sports and the broadcasting industry and am constantly seeking opportunities to grow my skills and knowledge in these fields.\n\nI have been able to broadcast Nebraska football, baseball, softball and basketball games as well as high school state basketball and volleyball on UNL’s student radio station, KRNU. Through these experiences, I have gained valuable hands-on experience and live reps as well as developing my communication skills and a strong work ethic.\n\nIn addition to my work with KRNU, I recently started an internship as a Production Intern with the Huskers Radio Network. I help to produce broadcasts on the network as well as the nightly show called “Sports Nightly.”\n\nI have also had the pleasure to work with Fox Sports as a student worker for football broadcasts. In this role, I assisted with a variety of tasks but mainly as a parabolic mic operator. This experience gave me a deeper understanding of the behind-the-scenes work that goes into producing a successful broadcast on the biggest of stages.\n\nLooking ahead, I am eager to continue to build my skills and experience in the sports media and broadcasting industries. I am dedicated to pursuing my passion and making meaningful contributions to the field."
